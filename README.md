Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Boston AirBnb Open data from Kaggle to better understand:

If a host responds early enough, is there greater possibility to get better ratings? 
Do biggers rooms in terms of square feet cost more than smaller ones? Or only factors such as number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms included affect the price?
Can some neighborhoods characterized as cheap or expensive? What percentage of listings cost more than the average price or even lower?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here. This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory enough in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
